<h1> Muffins, the early years </h1>
<hr>
<font color="white">Hi. My name is Muffins. I am a mighty cat. I was adopted by my family when I was 
<br>
only 3 weeks old.
<br>
<br>
My new mommy is a human. They are funny creatures.
<br>
<br>
I left the pound with my new mommy and new sister, Maria. They took me straight
<br>
to the pet store to buy:
<br>
<list> <ul>
<li>A kitty baby bottle and formula </li>
<br>
<li>A small cloth toy</li>
<br>
<li>Litter box with litter</li>
<br>
<li>Food (for later)</li> 
</ul> </list>
Mom and sis had to feed me by a bottle because I was so young.
